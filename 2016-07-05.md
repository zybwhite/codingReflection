### Database time related column. 
  1. If data is not related to timezone, recommended to use DateTime/TimeStamp
  2. If it is related to timezone but without complicated time related query, recommended to use varchar instead
  3. If it is related to timezone and together with complicated time related query, read datetime related docs and think carefully.
